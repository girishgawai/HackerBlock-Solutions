Given an array, the task is to calculate the sum of lengths of contiguous subarrays having all elements distinct

Input Format
An integer n denoting size of array followed by n integers

Constraints
1<=N<=10^5

Output Format
The answer mod 10^9+7

Sample Input
3
1 2 3
Sample Output
10
Explanation
{1, 2, 3} is a subarray of length 3 with distinct elements. Total length of length three = 3. {1, 2}, {2, 3} are 2 subarray of length 2 with distinct elements. Total 
length of lengths two = 2 + 2 = 4 {1}, {2}, {3} are 3 subarrays of length 1 with distinct element. Total lengths of length one = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 
Sum of lengths = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10
