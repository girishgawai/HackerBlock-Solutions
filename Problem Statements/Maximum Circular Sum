You are provided n numbers (both +ve and -ve). Numbers are arranged in a circular form. You need to find the maximum sum of consecutive numbers.

Input Format
First line contains integer t which is number of test case.
For each test case, it contains an integer n which is the size of array and next line contains n space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Constraints
1<=t<=100
1<=n<=1000
|Ai| <= 10000

Output Format
Print the maximum circular sum for each testcase in a new line.

Sample Input
1
7
8 -8 9 -9 10 -11 12
Sample Output
22
Explanation
Maximum Circular Sum = 22 (12 + 8 - 8 + 9 - 9 + 10)
