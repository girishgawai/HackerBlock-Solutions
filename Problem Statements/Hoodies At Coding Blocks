It's winter season. There is a long queue of students from the four prime courses at Coding Blocks and everyone is here to grab his hoodie. Each student of a course has a different roll number. Whenever a new student will come, he will search for his friend from the end of the queue. Note that a student can only has friend from his course and not from any other course. As soon as he will find any of the friend in the queue, he will stand behind him, otherwise he will stand at the end of the queue.
