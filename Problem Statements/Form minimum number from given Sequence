Given an array of patterns containing only I’s and D’s. I for increasing and D for decreasing. Devise an algorithm to print the minimum number following that pattern. Digits from 1-9 and digits can’t repeat.

Input Format
The First Line contains an Integer N, size of the array. Next Line contains N Strings separated by space.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ Length of String ≤ 8

Output Format
Print the minimum number for each String separated by a new Line.

Sample Input
4
D I DD II
Sample Output
21
12
321 
123
Explanation
For the Given sample case, For a Pattern of 'D' print a decreasing sequence which is 2 1.
