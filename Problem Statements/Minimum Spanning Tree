Given an undirected weighted graph with V nodes and E edges , find the weight of the minimum spanning tree. The IDs of the nodes are between 0 and n-1 inclusive.


Note : Try using both Kruskal and Prim's Algorithm for this problem

Input Format
First line contains two integers V and E.
Next E lines contain three space separated integers - u ,v and w
u and v are the nodes , w = weight of edge

Constraints
1 <= V <= 10000
1 <= E <= 100000
0 <= Weight of each edge <= 10000

Output Format
Display a single integer denoting the total weight of the minimum spanning tree.

Sample Input
4 5
0 1 10
1 2 15
0 2 5
3 1 2
3 2 40
Sample Output
17
Explanation
The edge between 2 & 3 with weight=15 and the edge between 3 & 4 with weight = 40 will not be a part of the final MST. The total weight of the remaining edges is 17.
