Given a singly linked list delete all nodes which are having a greater value among any of the nodes residing on the right side.

Input Format
First line contains N, the number of nodes in the linked list.
Next line contains the N nodes data .

Constraints
0<N<10^9

Output Format
Print the linked list after deleting the nodes which are having a greater value on right side.

Sample Input
8
12 15 10 11 5 6 2 3
Sample Output
15 11 6 3 
Explanation
In the given case 12 is having right node greater than itself i.e. 12<15 so delete it.
Similarly, 10<11, 5<6 and 2<3 so delete 10, 5 and 2 as well.
Thus, linked list becomes 15->11->6->3.
