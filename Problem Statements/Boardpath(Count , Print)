Take as input N, a number. N is the size of a snakes and ladder board (without any snakes and ladders). Take as input M, a number. M is the number of faces of the dice.

a. Write a recursive function which returns the count of different ways the board can be traveled using the dice. Print the value returned.

b. Write a recursive function which prints dice-values for all valid paths across the board (void is the return type for function).

Input Format
