Given a Binary Tree, write a program that returns the size of the largest subtree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST)

Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer n. The next line will contain n integers denoting the the preorder traversal of the BT. The next line will contain n more integers denoting the inorder traversal of the BT.

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^3

Output Format
A single integer denoting the size ( no of nodes in tree ) of largest BST in the given tree.

Sample Input
4
60 65 50 70
50 65 60 70
Sample Output
2
Explanation
The tree looks like

             60
          /      \
       65           70
     /           
   50       
The largest BST subtree is

       65           
     /           
   50       
which has the size 2 i.e. it has 2 nodes in it.
