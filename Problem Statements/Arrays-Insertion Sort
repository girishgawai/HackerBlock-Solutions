Given an array A of size N , write a function that implements insertion sort on the array. Print the elements of sorted array.

Input Format
First line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array. Next line contains N space seperated integers where ith integer is the ith element of the array.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000
|Ai| <= 1000000

Output Format
Output N space seperated integers of the sorted array in a single line.

Sample Input
4
3 4 2 1
Sample Output
1 2 3 4
