See explantaion for more info.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer N, the number of elements in the list.

The next line contains N space separated integral elements of the list.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000 0 <= N <= 10^6

Output Format
T lines of output

Sample Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output
1 3 5 2 4 
Explanation
Input : 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 11-> 4 -> 5

The order of odd elements and even does not change. For instance 3 comes before 5 in the input, so comes in the output.

Output: 1 -> 3 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4
