Given a binary tree, determine whether it is a BST.

Input Format
Level order traversals given where -1 means child is NULL

Constraints
-10^5<=nodes.data<=10^5

Output Format
true or false

Sample Input
20 10 30 -1 -1 5 40 -1 -1 -1 -1 
Sample Output
false
Explanation
In the tree above, each node meets the condition that the node contains a value larger than its left child and smaller than its right child hold, and yet itâ€™s not a BST: the value 5 is on the right subtree of the node containing 20, a violation of the BST property.
