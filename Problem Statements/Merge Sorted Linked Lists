Given 2 sorted linked lists , merge the two given sorted linked list and print the final Linked List.

Input Format
First Line contains T the number of test cases.
For each test case :
Line 1 : N1 the size of list 1
Line 2 : N1 elements for list 1
Line 3 : N2 the size of list 2
Line 4 : N2 elements for list 2

Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
0<= N1, N2 <= 10^6
-10^7 <= Ai <= 10^7

Output Format
For each testcase , print the node data of merged linked list.

Sample Input
1
4
1 3 5 7
3
2 4 6
Sample Output
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
