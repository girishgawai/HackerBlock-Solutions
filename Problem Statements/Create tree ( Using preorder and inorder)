Given preorder and inorder create the tree

Input Format
Enter the size of the preorder array N then add N more elements and store in the array denoting the preorder traversal of the tree. Then enter the size of the inorder array M and add M more elements and store the inorder traversal of the array.

Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 10^4

Output Format
Display the tree using a modified preorder function. For each node , first print its left child's data , then the data of the root itself , then the data of its right child. Do this for each node in a new line in preorder manner. If one of the children does not exist print END in its place. Refer to the sample testcase.

Sample Input
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
Sample Output
2 => 1 <= END
3 => 2 <= END
END => 3 <= END
