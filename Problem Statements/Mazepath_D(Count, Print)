Take as input N1 and N2, both numbers. N1 and N2 is the number of rows and columns on a rectangular board. Our player starts in top-left corner of the board and must reach bottom-right corner. In one move the player can move 1 step horizontally (right) or 1 step vertically (down) or 1 step diagonally (south-east).

a. Write a recursive function which returns the count of different ways the player can travel across the board. Print the value returned.

b. Write a recursive function which prints moves for all valid paths across the board (void is the return type for function).
